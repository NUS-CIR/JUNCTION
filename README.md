# JUNCTION

JUNCTION: A Scalable Multi-access Solution using Programmable Switches.

## Overview

This repository holds the `JUNCTION-GW` implementation in P4 as detailed in the paper. 

> Important Notes: 
> - The currently released code is an early working version of `JUNCTION-GW` (codename `Heimdall`), dating back to late 2022. Thus, there may be some discrepancies compared to what is described in the JUNCTION paper. That said, the current codebase should provide valuable insights into `JUNCTION-GW`'s actual implementation for now.
> - The final version of `JUNCTION-GW`'s implementation is currently being prepared (i.e., code sanitization, documentation, and unit tests) for final release. We expect to make the complete version available by the end of Q1 2025.
We thank you for your patience.
